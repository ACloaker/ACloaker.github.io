## CPSC 120

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 is one of my favorites because I learned how to use three loops within one another. I also learned how to create an image using lines, dashes, and bars. My teammates were also great and we worked well together.

*Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 1 is another favorite because I was able to learn how to work with vectors. My group specifically learned 2D vectors in this lab and I thought it was interesting to see how they work in C++. It was a little challenging but it was fun.

*Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 is my last favorite because I learned how to use GraphicsMagick. I liked learning how to create a gradient gif since it looks cool. This lab wasn't too difficult, my group didn't have too many errors this time around.
